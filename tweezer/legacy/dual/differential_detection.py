    This function implements the differential detection, described by Moffitt et al., PNAS 2006.
    It returns the factors a1 and a2 for the optimal linear combination of the two bead deflections
    that minimises the noise. The factors are adjusted in a way, that one of them (a2) is 1 as the
    paper only gives an equation for the ratio a1 / a2.

    Args:
        xi   - bead deflection at trap i (in nm)
        jki   - trap stiffnesses (in pN / nm)
        ri   - bead radii (in nm)
        dist - distance from bead to bead (in nm)
        kDna - DNA stiffness (in pN / nm)
        viscosity  - well, the viscosity of the medium (in pN * s / nm^2)

    Returns:
        ai - factor for optimal linear combination of x1 and x2
