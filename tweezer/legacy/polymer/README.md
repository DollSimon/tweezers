Functions and routines related to semi-flexible polymers.

Most importantly, different versions of the worm-like chain model are implemented.

### Worm-like chain model

The extended worm-like chain model is given by:

$$ x(F, L, P, S) = L\big(1 - \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{k T}{P F}} + \frac{F}{S}\big) $$
